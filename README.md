# SpysoftKeyloggerPlus
A free keylogger made in Python.

If you care to, please donate me money for my efforts. All money donated will be used in training courses for me to learn how to give better names to my programs.

### Running the keylogger from source code

- Install python2.7
- Add python to your environment variables
- Run with python main.py
- To stop logging, use ctrl-c anywhere
- The logfile will be called log.txt, and will be in the same directory as main.py

### Supported locales
pt_PT

### Supported operating systems
Windows

### How can I help?
You can't. You will be once I have time for adjusting the code for supporting serveral locales and eventually if I feel like making a GUI, several languages, but that isn't gonna happen until I finish some university work.
