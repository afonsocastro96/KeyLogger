# SpysoftKeyloggerPlus
A free keylogger made in Python.

If you care to, please donate me money for my efforts. All money donated will be used in training courses for me to learn how to give better names to my programs.

### Running the keylogger

#### From source code
- Clone the repo, or if you don't want to get the other files, copy main.py
- Install python2.7
- Add python to your environment variables
- Run with python main.py
- To stop logging, use ctrl-c anywhere
- The logfile will be called log.txt, and will be in the same directory as main.py

#### From the executable
- Clone the repo / grab the logger.exe file from the bin folder
- Run it.
- To stop logging, use ctrl-c anywhere
- The logfile will be called log.txt, and will be in the same directory as the executable. It can't really get easier than this.


### Supported locales
pt_PT

### Supported operating systems
Windows

### How can I help?
Aside from suggesting features (use [this](https://github.com/sceptross/KeyLogger/issues) page for that, by clicking in "New issue") you can't. You will be able to once I have time for adjusting the code for supporting serveral locales and eventually if I feel like making a GUI, several languages, but that isn't gonna happen until I finish some university work. Every suggestion you make will really only be implementable after that.
